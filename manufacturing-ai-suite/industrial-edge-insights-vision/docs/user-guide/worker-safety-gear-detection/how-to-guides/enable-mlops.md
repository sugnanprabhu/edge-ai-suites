# Enable MLOps

Applications for industrial edge insights vision can also be used to demonstrate MLOps workflow using Model Download microservice.
With this feature, during runtime, you can download a new model using the microservice and restart the pipeline with the new model.

> To simplify this demonstration, we assume that models have already been downloaded to an accessible location (`/tmp/models`) using the Model Download from a running Geti server before restarting the pipeline.

## Contents

### Prerequisites

We assume that Model Download service has already downloaded the model to be updated to `/tmp/models`.
To learn how to setup Model Download, see [here](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/dev/edge-ai-libraries/model-download/get-started.html#start-with-setup-script)

If not available, you can simulate this by downloading the sample model from edge-ai-resources repository [here](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-resources/blob/main/models/INT8/worker-safety-gear-detection.zip). Once downloaded, extract to `/tmp/models` directory.

### Steps

> **Note:** If you are running multiple instances of app, ensure to provide `NGINX_HTTPS_PORT` number in the url for the app instance, i.e., replace `<HOST_IP>` with `<HOST_IP>:<NGINX_HTTPS_PORT>`.
> If you are running a single instance and using an `NGINX_HTTPS_PORT` other than the default 443, replace `<HOST_IP>` with `<HOST_IP>:<NGINX_HTTPS_PORT>`.

1. Set up the sample application to start a pipeline. A pipeline named `worker_safety_gear_detection_mlops` is already provided in the `pipeline-server-config.json` for this demonstration with the Worker Safety Gear Detection sample app.

    > Ensure that the pipeline inference element such as gvadetect/gvaclassify/gvainference should not have a `model-instance-id` property set. If set, this would not allow the new model to be run with the same value provided in the model-instance-id.

    Navigate to the `[WORKDIR]/edge-ai-suites/manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-vision` directory and set up the app.

    ```sh
    cp .env_worker-safety-gear-detection .env
    ```

2. Update the following variables in `.env` file

    ``` sh
    HOST_IP= # <IP Adress of the host machine>

    MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=   # MinIO service & client access key e.g. intel1234
    MINIO_SECRET_KEY=   # MinIO service & client secret key e.g. intel1234

    MTX_WEBRTCICESERVERS2_0_USERNAME=  # Webrtc-mediamtx username. e.g intel1234
    MTX_WEBRTCICESERVERS2_0_PASSWORD=  # Webrtc-mediamtx password. e.g intel1234
    ```

3. Run the setup script using the following command

    ```sh
    ./setup.sh
    ```

4. Bring up the containers

    ```sh
    docker compose up -d
    ```

5. Check to see if the pipeline is loaded is present which in our case is `worker_safety_gear_detection_mlops`.

    ```sh
    ./sample_list.sh
    ```

6. Modify the payload in `apps/worker-safety-gear-detection/payload.json` to launch an instance for the MLOps pipeline

    ```json
    [
        {
            "pipeline": "worker_safety_gear_detection_mlops",
            "payload":{
                "source": {
                    "uri": "file:///home/pipeline-server/resources/videos/Safety_Full_Hat_and_Vest.avi",
                    "type": "uri"
                },
                "destination": {
                "frame": {
                    "type": "webrtc",
                    "peer-id": "worker_safety"
                }
                },
                "parameters": {
                    "detection-properties": {
                        "model": "/home/pipeline-server/resources/models/worker-safety-gear-detection/deployment/Detection/model/model.xml",
                        "device": "CPU"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    ]
    ```

7. Start the pipeline with the above payload.

   ```sh
   ./sample_start.sh -p worker_safety_gear_detection_mlops
   ```

8. Verify the pipeline is running. You can View the WebRTC streaming on `https://<HOST_IP>/mediamtx/<peer-str-id>` by replacing `<peer-str-id>` with the value used in the original cURL command to start the pipeline.

#### Downloading a Model with Model Download

At this point, restart the pipeline with a newer model. The new model can be a retrained version of the existing model or a different model altogether. We use [Model Download](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/dev/edge-ai-libraries/model-download/index.html) microservice to help download the model. It supports downloading public models as well as Geti™ models from a running Geti™ server. To learn more about it, see [here](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/dev/edge-ai-libraries/model-download/get-started.html).

For our demonstration, we assume that:

- the Worker Safety Gear Detection model has been retrained and is available for download from a Geti server using the Model Download service.
- the downloaded location is accessible by the DL Streamer Pipeline Server. In our example, it is `/tmp/models`.
- the `/tmp` directory is already accessible by the sample application. If not, add it to the `volumes` section of `dlstreamer-pipeline-server` service in the Docker Compose file.

1. Stop the running pipeline by using the pipeline instance "id".

   ```sh
   curl -k --location -X DELETE https://<HOST_IP>/api/pipelines/{instance_id}
   ```

2. Start a new pipeline with this new model. Before that modify the payload.json to use this new model in `apps/worker-safety-gear-detection/payload.json`. Notice the model path in the payload has changed to the new model.

    ```json
    [
        {
            "pipeline": "worker_safety_gear_detection_mlops",
            "payload":{
                "source": {
                    "uri": "file:///home/pipeline-server/resources/videos/Safety_Full_Hat_and_Vest.avi",
                    "type": "uri"
                },
                "destination": {
                "frame": {
                    "type": "webrtc",
                    "peer-id": "worker_safety"
                }
                },
                "parameters": {
                    "detection-properties": {
                        "model": "/tmp/models/worker-safety-gear-detection/deployment/Detection/model/model.xml",
                        "device": "CPU"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    ]
    ```

    Run the following.

    ```bash
    ./sample_start.sh -p worker_safety_gear_detection_mlops
    ```

3. View the WebRTC streaming on `https://<HOST_IP>/mediamtx/<peer-str-id>` by replacing `<peer-str-id>` with the value used in the original cURL command to start the pipeline.

### Downloading models from Geti Server

To learn how to download models from a running Geti server, see [here](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/dev/edge-ai-libraries/model-download/get-started.html#sample-usage-with-curl-command).

> **Note:** The downloaded model(s) must be accessible to the DL Streamer Pipeline Server container. If necessary, add it to volumes section of `dlstreamer-pipeline-server` in Docker Compose file, and restart the DLSPS service.
