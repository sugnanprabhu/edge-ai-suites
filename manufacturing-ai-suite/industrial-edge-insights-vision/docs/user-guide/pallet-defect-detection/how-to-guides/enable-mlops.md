# Enable MLOps

Applications for industrial edge insights vision can also be used to demonstrate MLOps workflow using Model Download microservice.
With this feature, during runtime, you can download a new model using the microservice and restart the pipeline with the new model.

> To simplify this demonstration, we assume that models have already been downloaded to an accessible location (`/tmp/models`) using the Model Download from a running Geti server before restarting the pipeline.

## Contents

### Prerequisites

We assume that Model Download service has already downloaded the model to be updated to `/tmp/models`.
To learn how to setup Model Download, see [here](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/2026.1/edge-ai-libraries/model-download/get-started.html#start-with-setup-script)

If not available, you can simulate this by downloading the sample model from the [`edge-ai-resources` repository](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-resources/blob/main/models/INT8/pallet_defect_detection.zip). Once downloaded, extract to `/tmp/models` directory.

### Steps

> **Note:** If you are running multiple instances of the app, ensure to provide `NGINX_HTTPS_PORT` number in the url for the app instance, i.e., replace `<HOST_IP>` with `<HOST_IP>:<NGINX_HTTPS_PORT>`.
> If you are running a single instance and using an `NGINX_HTTPS_PORT` other than the default 443, replace `<HOST_IP>` with `<HOST_IP>:<NGINX_HTTPS_PORT>`.

1. Set up the sample application to start a pipeline. A pipeline named `pallet_defect_detection_mlops` is already provided in the `pipeline-server-config.json` for this demonstration with the pallet defect detection sample app.

   > Ensure that the pipeline inference element such as gvadetect/gvaclassify/gvainference should not have a `model-instance-id` property set. If set, this would not allow the new model to be run with the same value provided in the `model-instance-id`.

   Navigate to the `[WORKDIR]/edge-ai-suites/manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-vision` directory and set up the app.

   ```sh
   cp .env_pallet-defect-detection .env
   ```

2. Update the following variables in `.env` file.

   ```sh
   HOST_IP= # <IP Address of the host machine>

   MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=   # MinIO service & client access key e.g. intel1234
   MINIO_SECRET_KEY=   # MinIO service & client secret key e.g. intel1234

   MTX_WEBRTCICESERVERS2_0_USERNAME=  # Webrtc-mediamtx username. e.g intel1234
   MTX_WEBRTCICESERVERS2_0_PASSWORD=  # Webrtc-mediamtx password. e.g intel1234
   ```

3. Run the setup script using the following command.

   ```sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```

4. Bring up the containers

   ```sh
   docker compose up -d
   ```

5. Check to see if the pipeline is present among the list of loaded pipelines which in our case is `pallet_defect_detection_mlops`.

   ```sh
   ./sample_list.sh
   ```

6. Modify the payload in `apps/pallet-defect-detection/payload.json` to launch an instance for the mlops pipeline.

   ```json
   [
     {
       "pipeline": "pallet_defect_detection_mlops",
       "payload": {
         "source": {
           "uri": "file:///home/pipeline-server/resources/videos/warehouse.avi",
           "type": "uri"
         },
         "destination": {
           "frame": {
             "type": "webrtc",
             "peer-id": "pdd"
           }
         },
         "parameters": {
           "detection-properties": {
             "model": "/home/pipeline-server/resources/models/pallet-defect-detection/deployment/Detection/model/model.xml",
             "device": "CPU"
           }
         }
       }
     }
   ]
   ```

7. Start the pipeline with the above payload.

   ```bash
   ./sample_start.sh -p pallet_defect_detection_mlops
   ```

   Note the instance-id of the pipeline launched.

8. Verify the pipeline is running. You can View the WebRTC streaming on `https://<HOST_IP>/mediamtx/<peer-str-id>` by replacing `<peer-str-id>` with the value used in the original cURL command to start the pipeline.

   #### Downloading a Model with Model Download

   At this point, restart the pipeline with a newer model. The new model can be a retrained version of the existing model or a different model altogether. We use the [Model Download](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/2026.1/edge-ai-libraries/model-download/index.html) microservice to help download the model. It supports downloading public models as well as Geti models from a running Geti server. To learn more about the microservice, see how to [get started with it](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/2026.1/edge-ai-libraries/model-download/get-started.html).

   For our demonstration, we assume that:
   - the Pallet Defect Detection model has been retrained and is available for download from a Geti server using the Model Download service.
   - the downloaded location is accessible by the DL Streamer Pipeline Server. In our example, it is `/tmp/models`.
   - the `/tmp` directory is already accessible by the sample application. If not, add it to the `volumes` section of `dlstreamer-pipeline-server` service in the docker-compose file.

9. Stop the running pipeline by using the pipeline instance "id".

   ```sh
   curl -k --location -X DELETE https://<HOST_IP>/api/pipelines/{instance_id}
   ```

10. Start a new pipeline with this new model. Before that modify the payload.json to use this new model in `apps/pallet-defect-detection/payload.json`. Notice the model path in the payload has changed to the new model.

    ```json
    [
      {
        "pipeline": "pallet_defect_detection_mlops",
        "payload": {
          "source": {
            "uri": "file:///home/pipeline-server/resources/videos/warehouse.avi",
            "type": "uri"
          },
          "destination": {
            "frame": {
              "type": "webrtc",
              "peer-id": "pdd"
            }
          },
          "parameters": {
            "detection-properties": {
              "model": "/tmp/models/pallet-defect-detection/deployment/Detection/model/model.xml",
              "device": "CPU"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    ]
    ```

    Run the following.

    ```bash
    ./sample_start.sh -p pallet_defect_detection_mlops
    ```

11. View the WebRTC streaming on `https://<HOST_IP>/mediamtx/<peer-str-id>` by replacing `<peer-str-id>` with the value used in the original cURL command to start the pipeline.

### Downloading models from Geti Server

To learn how to download models from a running Geti server, see [here](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/2026.1/edge-ai-libraries/model-download/get-started.html#sample-usage-with-curl-command).

> **Note:** The downloaded model(s) must be accessible to the DL Streamer Pipeline Server container. If necessary, add it to volumes section of `dlstreamer-pipeline-server` in compose file, and restart the DLSPS service.
